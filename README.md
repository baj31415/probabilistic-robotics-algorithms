# Probabilistic Robotics Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of key algorithms from the [Probabilistic Robotics](http://robots.stanford.edu/probabilistic-robotics/) book by Thrun et al.

Key algorithms to be implemented:

- [ ] Recursive Bayes Filter
- [ ] Motion Model
- [ ] Observation Model
- [ ] Kalman Filter
- [ ] Partice Filter
